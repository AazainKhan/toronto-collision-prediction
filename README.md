## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model (classifier) and deploy it as a web API for inference. The model predicts the likelihood of fatal collisions involving loss of life based on certain features. The purpose is to assist both the police department and the general public in assessing road safety conditions and planning security measures accordingly.
